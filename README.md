# libft
libft is my implementation of the standard library as a project
for 42.  You will find a unit-test that you can run.  Look at the
documentation inside for more info. An implemented main.c located
outside of the unit test is my implementation of all the functions
and a few other ones. (pending to finish).

#frozen
frozen is an implementation of an IRC using golang to create a client chat.
