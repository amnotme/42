# From the shell of a debian container, install via the containerâ€™s package 
# manager everything you need to compile C source code and push it onto a git 
# repo (of course, make sure before that the package manager and the packages 
# already in the container are updated). For this exercise, you should only 
# specify the commands to be run directly in the container.
