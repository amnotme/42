Choose one of you neighbors, and ask her/him :
"What do you think of using a namespace instead of a class to represent fixed point
values ? I mean, with a scoped typedef on int, we could write scoped functions and save
the cost of instanciations, but at the same time, we’d loose some handy syntax. What’s
your point of view ?"
This exercice won’t give you points. It’s just a little break in the day to take time to
look back at what you learned during the past three days.
If you want to skip this, fine. I don’t care. You will probably end up being a web
developper anyway >.> !


Maya:

"Using namespace will allow me to save a few extra lines that I don't have to
code at the expense of having to explicitly write the class name"
